A canopy that may fit a 9-foot octagonal umbrella from one brand will not necessarily fit the same size and shape canopy from another brand. When ordering a replacement canopy, you will first want to know the brand, model, size and shape of your existing umbrella, as well as the number of ribs. Canopies are super easy to replace for both market and cantilever umbrellas and can typically be swapped out in a matter of minutes.
